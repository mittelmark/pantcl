# Introduction

This is a sample with some example code chunks.

# Code chunks

```{.tcl}
set x 1
puts $x
```


This a Tcl variable, x is `tcl set x`.




Let's try out now `foo @text bar`.
I will write some more text ...

```{.tcl}
incr x
```

This is some more text with tcl where x is now: `tcl set x` and let's try to
write 'foo @text bar' again.

Can I write a @ symbol?
